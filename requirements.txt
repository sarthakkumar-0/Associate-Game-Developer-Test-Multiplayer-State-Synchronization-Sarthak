Multiplayer
 
State
 
Synchronization
 
Objective  
Develop  a  simple  real-time  multiplayer  Coin  Collector  game  that  synchronizes  player  
movement
 
and
 
game
 
state
 
through
 
a
 
central
 
server.
 
Candidates
 
must
 
not
 
rely
 
on
 
engines
 
or
 
frameworks
 
that
 
automatically
 
perform
 
networking
 
or
 
state
 
syncing.
 
Technology  Requirements  
●  Permitted  languages:  Any  (C#,  C/C++,  JavaScript  /  Node.js,  Python,  Go,  etc.)  ●  Networking  constraint:  ○  You  may  use  Raw  TCP/UDP  sockets,  WebSockets,  or  gRPC  ●  Not  Allowed:  ○  Networking  middleware  that  auto-syncs  state  (e.g.,  Photon,  Netcode  for  
GameObjects,
 
Mirror,
 
etc.)
 
Architecture  
The  submission  must  consist  of  two  distinct,  running  components:  
●  A  central,  authoritative  Game  Server .  ●  One  or  more  connecting  Clients  (players). 
Part  A:  Game  Requirements  
1.  Lobby:  Two  clients  must  connect  to  a  game  server.  The  server  can  wait  for  input  or  
auto-start
 
the
 
game
 
session.
 2.  Gameplay:  ○  Each  player  controls  a  basic  shape  (cube,  circle,  etc.).  ○  Coins  spawn  at  random  map  positions  every  few  seconds.  ○  When  a  player  touches  a  coin,  it  disappears  and  that  player’s  score  increases.  3.  Server  Authority:  ○  The  server  is  authoritative  for  player  positions,  coin  positions,  and  scoring.  ○  Clients  may  only  send  intent  or  input  (e.g.,  “move  left”).  ○  The  server  resolves  collisions  and  validates  score  events.  
Part  B  :  Network  Quality  Simulation  
You  must  simulate  degraded  network  conditions:  
●  Introduce  ~200ms  latency  to  all  data  sent  and  received.  
This  constraint  is  critical  :  the  test  is  not  merely  functional,  but  resilience-oriented.  
Part  C  :  Evaluation  Criteria  
1.  Smoothness  (Interpolation):  
 
Since
 
positional
 
data
 
arrives
 
at
 
delayed
 
intervals,
 
naive
 
rendering
 
causes
 
visible
 
stutter.
 
 
Candidates
 
must
 
implement
 
entity
 
interpolation
 
such
 
that
 
remote
 
players
 
move
 
smoothly
 
on-screen.
 
 2.  Security  (Server  Authority):  ○  Clients  cannot  self-report  coin  pickups  or  spoof  movement.  ○  The  server  must  validate  proximity  and  maintain  the  canonical  game  state.  
 
Required  Output  
1.  GitHub  Repository  ○  Clean,  readable  code  ○  Run  instructions  and  any  other  details  in  the  README  
 2.  Unlisted  Video  Demonstration  ○  Show  two  client  screens  simultaneously  ○  Demonstrate  smooth  motion  (despite  200ms  latency)  ○  Demonstrate  correct  authoritative  scoring  
Scoring  
We  will  be  valuing  the  quality  of  the  end  result  along  with  effort  and  understanding.  Just  ensure  
the
 
links
 
are
 
accessible
 
and
 
instructions
 
are
 
followed
 
exactly.
 
When  in  doubt,  make  a  reasonable  assumption  and  if  you  feel  like  it,  call  it  out  in  the  Readme.
